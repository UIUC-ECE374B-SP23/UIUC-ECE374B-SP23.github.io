#### Big Questions

This course is focused on answering three big questions: 

- Given infinite time, how can we group problems by their "complexity" (Computability-theory)
- Given finite time, but a problem we know is computable, how fast can we solve the problem (Algorithmic design)
- Given a problem whihc is difficult to solve, can we infer how slow/fast we can solve it by comparing it to other known problems (Reductions)

#### Two types of complexity

| Computational Complexity      | Algorithmic Complexity |
