<!-- ## Classification of mathematical tokens in technical literature -->

#### Problem

While knowing what textual definitions best describe a math token, it'd be useful if we knew more basic information about the token: 
<ul>
    <li> If it's a variable, constant, or operator </li>
    <li> If it's a scalar or matrix </li>
    <li> If it's a known global-, commonly-used entity or if it is locally-defined</li>
</ul>

The goal of this project is formalize this problem.
