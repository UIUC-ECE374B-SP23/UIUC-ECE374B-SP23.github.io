#### Problem

Certain mathematical equations are used in a variety of scientific disciplines and these different disciplines would be well served better connect with one another. For instance, the same expression can be used in two wildly different fields of study as shown in the figure above. Connecting mathematical expressions via the mathematical expressions should enable us to create a knowledge map where each area of research is connected to other discipline by similar mathematical functions.
