Couple things to note about exams:
- All the midterms will be administered during lecture time in the usual lecture room. 
- The final will be conducted according to the registrar's schedule. 

### Exam Policies

Besides the obvious "don't cheat" exam policies outlined in the 

#### Exam Drop

**Exam drop replaces conflict exams.** As per the grading policy, we have included one more exam than normal so that students can drop one exam a semester. This exam drop has the same purpose as the HW drop - to give students a buffer for those times when life gets in the way. Should you get sick or maybe have a moment of panic during one of the exams, you now have a drop so that one grade won't sink you. 

#### Cheatsheet

I've wrestled with the concept of cheatsheets a lot in past semesters. Ideally, what a cheatsheet is for is to help you memorize tedious equations or details that are easy to forget. However, I like to give exam questions that are very similar to the HWs/labs. Last semester I noticed that cheat sheets didn't contain definitions/algorithms. Instead, they contained copied questions and solutions of HW/lab problems. Basically cheat sheets had become a "guess what Kani might put on the exam"-sheet. Worse, many, many people simply copied the cheatsheet solutions and were frustrated when they learned that those solutions didn't apply to the exam problems. This leaves me with two options: 

- Make sure that the exam problems are changed up so that copying from a HW/lab problem would hurt more than help. 
- Eliminate cheatsheets altogether. 

I think I've come up with a solution that'd help everyone. Over the course of two semesters, we've constructed a communal cheat sheet for each of the exams. These cheat sheets will be posted on the website well in advance of the exam and will be attached to the back of the exam. 

This lets me use problems that many of you have seen before but know that the people answering those problems are doing so because they actually mastered the material. 

#### Use pen

The exams will be scanned and uploaded to gradescope where they will be graded by the TAs. Unfortunately, last semester we had a problem with a number of individuals that used a pencil with a light touch causing the exam to be illegible. Therefore we're banning pencils. If we see a exam that is difficult to read, we will take off points.  


### Regrades

Regrades requests would be open for a week once grades are released (except for final exam). Regrade requests are not intended for arguing about point allocation, or whether or not the grading scale is fair.

Unfortunately, certain students think that they can tire us into giving them point that they did not earn, by keep asking for unjustified regrade requests. As such, superfluous, argumentative and repetitive regrade requests, after an appropriate warning, would results in a zero on the relevant questions - please do not waste our time.
