description: What to do if you get covid (or any other illness).

Unfortunately, the Covid situation doesn't seem to end anytime some but the good news is that we have vaccines that will *mostly* protect us. By being on campus, you are certifying that you are in full compliance with the [university's covid policies](https://covid19.illinois.edu/).  

Even so, likely that a number of us will get sick during the semester. So the question is, **what should you do?** 

First of all, do not come to campus. Stay home and focus on getting better. If you start feeling really sick, go to the doctor. Your health matters more than any grade so please do your best to recover. 

* Exams, quizzes and homework have lots of drops. Hence if an illness forces you to miss any of these, never fear, you have drops. It will likely very minimally impact your grade. 
* Lectures are recorded and will be posted to mediaspace automatically. I will post a annotated version of the lecture to Youtube as soon as I'm able to as well (within a couple of days). Additionally, Prof. Har-Peled has recorded a series of lectures that cover the material as well. 
* Discussion solutions are posted on the website.  

So, in summation, make sure to get better and it is very possible to take this course remotely (for a short while) should you get sick.
