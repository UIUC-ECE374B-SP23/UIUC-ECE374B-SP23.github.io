title: Grading Policy

description: How your final grade is calculated. 
---

There are three components to your raw total: 

- [Homeworks](/homeworks.html): 24%
    - Remeber we have a drop policy so if you miss a homework due to illness or did not perform as well as you'd hoped, you have an opportunity to bounce back. 
    - Specifically, we will include only the top 34 homework problems (including the lab problems) scores in computing your final grade. We expect to grade 9 homeworks, each with 4-5 problems. Should for some reason we would grade less homework problems, we will still use the top 34 homework problems.
    - If you submit everything, this policy is equivalent to dropping 9 homework problems.
    - **If you submit less than 25 homework problems** you are likely to fail unless there is an overriding excuse.
- [Exams](/exams.html): 75%
    - There will be three midterm exams, and a cumulative final exam. 
    - **We will drop the lowest exam grade (including the final).** Hence, each exam is worth 25% but if you screw one up, never fear, one exam will get dropped. Alternatively, if you do well on the midterms and want to skip the final, go for it! We will try our best to give students a projected final grade after the third midterm.
    - Keep in mind that regardless of the exam you drop, you will still be tested on the entire course content since the final is cumulative. 
    - There will be no conflicts. The drop policy is speciifcally for indivduals that need a bit of a break for whatever reason (illness, duty, etc.). 
    - I don't want to be the arbiter of what is and isn't a valid reason to miss your work (and neither should students have to plead and hope for mercy from professors). That is why I constructed this policy that is merciful but will apply it strictly. If you have a serious issue that cause you to miss two or more midterms, you need to contact your department's advising office and/or the [emergency dean](/policies/stressed).
- ICES form: 1%
    - Every semester I send minimum of 3-4 reminder emails asking students to complete the ICES forms and I've never been able to get above 35% participation.
    - I need feedback because I liek to iterate on the course every semester and try to make it better. This is a very different course than 2 years ago and I hope it'll be different in 2 years time as well. 
    - Prior to the grade estimate release, you must submit a screenshot on gradescope that shows you've completed your ICES evaluations. If you don't you will get a zero for this part of your grade. 
    - While this isn't a major component, many students have been less that 1% away from the next grade cutoff. Don't risk it, take 5 minutes and fill out the form (for all your courses).


#### Regrade requests

All regrade requests would be handled via Gradescope. Regrade requests can be submitted at most a week after the grades are posted on Gradescope.

- **Make sure the Canvas Gradebook is correct.** The only reason why I'm keeping Canvas around is because I want to be open about the grades I have recorded so you guys can keep me honest and point out anything that seems amiss. 
- **Please check that your grades are tabulated and recorded correctly.** If you notice a mistake, please use Gradescope to ask for a regrade. Regrade period for homeworks/exams is one week after the grade is available.
- **If you do not understand your grade on a homework or exam problem, please discuss your grade with one of the instructors or TAs during office hours.** After that discussion, if you still believe that your work has been graded incorrectly, please request a regrade.
- Late regrade requests will be ignored. Homework and exam regrades can be requested within Gradescope.
- **All regrade requests must include a written succinct justification for the request.** Good justifications include the following:
    - My answer agrees with the posted solution, but I still lost points.
    - You took off points for missing the base case, but it's right here (right here!).
    - My answer is correct, even though it does not match the posted solution. (This happens more frequently if your answer is not even remotely similar to the "standard" solution.)
    - The official solution is incorrect; here's a counterexample.

    **Regrade requests with poor or missing justifications will be denied.**
- You will lose all points on a question if you waste our time by submitting repeatedly unjustified regrade requests.
- **We can only grade what you actually submitted.** You cannot get a higher grade by explaining what you meant, either in person or in writing; your original submission must stand on its own.
- If you submit a regrade request, we will regrade the submitted problem from *scratch*. The TAs will regrade homework problems; Instructors will regrade exam problems. **Your grade may go down.**
- We will readily admit, apologize for, and correct our mistakes if you have been graded unfairly. However, please remember that "unfairly" means your grade is inconsistent with the published grading rubric, or that you were graded more harshly than other students, not just that you think the rubric itself is too harsh. Please also keep in mind that each homework point is worth approximately 0.1% of your final course grade. Don't fight for each point like your life depends on it - it does not!
- You would lose points (and potentially all of them) for long and tedious solutions.

#### Extra Credit

Extra credit (which would given completely in the discretion of the instructors) would be given in exceptional cases for the following:

- Being in the top few participants on piazza. (As long as most of your answers are useful and correct [and add to the current discussion {i.e., don't repost others answers just to increase your count}] - a campaign of disinformation on piazza would gain you little.)
- Taking on small, interesting problem/research challenges I may post to Piazza.
- Extra credit is only given to people that have completed *significantly* more work than is required for this course. Significant means tens of hours of solid work/effort.
