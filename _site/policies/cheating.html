                <h1>Don't cheat</h1>
            

            <p>This policy statement is unfortunately necessary, thanks to the actions of a tiny minority of students. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask in lecture, in lab, during office hours, on Piazza, or by email.</p>

<p>tl;dr Links to an external site.: Be honest. Cite your sources. We mean it. If you need help, please ask. Don’t be stupid!</p>

<h4 id="our-expectations">Our expectations</h4>

<p><strong>Each student (or homework group) must write their own solutions, in their own words, and must properly credit all sources.</strong></p>

<p>For more information and examples, see any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ECE department <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/ugrad/advising-tips/academic-honesty">policy</a></li>
  <li>The Provost Office’s Students’ <a href="https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/academic-integrity/students-quick-reference-guide-to-academic-integrity/">Quick Reference Guide to Academic Integrity</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/">Article 1, Part 4 of the Student Code.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any doubts about whether something constitutes plagiarism, talk to instructor(s) or the TAs, and err on the side of caution.</p>

<h6 id="cite-your-sources">Cite your sources</h6>

<p>We strongly encourage you to use any printed, online, or living resource at your disposal to help you solve homework problems, but you must cite your sources.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you use an idea from a book, cite the book.</li>
  <li>If you use an idea from a paper, cite the paper.</li>
  <li>If you use an idea from Wikipedia, cite Wikipedia.</li>
  <li>If you use an idea from CS StackExchange, cite CS StackExchange.</li>
  <li>If you use an idea from last semester’s homework solutions, cite last semester’s homework solutions.</li>
  <li>If you use an idea from another student, cite that student.</li>
  <li>If you use an idea from your mom, cite your mom.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are only two exceptions to this rule. <strong>You are not required to cite the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Official course materials (lectures, lecture notes, homework and exam solutions <em>from this semester</em>)</li>
  <li>Sources for prerequisite material (which we assume you already know by heart)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="penalties">Penalties</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The default penalty for cheating on a homework problem is <em>a grade of zero on the entire homework set</em>, which we will not drop when we compute your final course grade. (In practice, the effect of this penalty is about half of a letter grade.)</li>
  <li>The default penalty for cheating on an exam is a grade of zero <em>on the entire exam</em>, which we will not drop when we compute your final course grade. (In practice, the effect of this penalty is roughly two full letter grades.)</li>
  <li>The default penalty for cheating on multiple assignments in an F in the course. Doesn’t matter if this is your first violation or yoru third. A consistent pattern of cheating in the course if grounds for immediate failure.</li>
  <li>We reserve the right to register FAIR violations at any point in the semester (even once the semester is over). FAIR violations are time-consuming for the staff so multiple cheating offenses could be included in a single violation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t be an idiot. Just do the work.</p>

<h4 id="group-work">Group Work</h4>

<p>Groups of up to three people are allowed to submit a single solution for each homework. Every member of the group receives the same grade and the same credit for the entire assignment. That means every member of the group is responsible for the entire assignment.</p>

<p><strong>Group solutions must represent an honest collaborative effort by all members of the group.</strong> In particular, groups must not delegate one problem to each group member; only the students who actively worked on a problem may add their names to the solution. <strong>At a minimum, you must read, understand, and approve anything submitted with your name on it. Allowing someone else to add your name to a solution to which you made no contribution is plagiarism.</strong> This does not mean that every student in a group must contribute good ideas or must help in the actual writing of every group solution. Asking “stupid” questions, proposing bad ideas, shooting down bad ideas, working out examples (even if they don’t appear in the solution), uncovering bugs, and even just acting as a sounding board for other group members are all legitimate contributions.</p>

<p>If a submitted homework contains plagiarized material, we will separately determine each student’s culpability (if any) and penalty (if any), in accordance with Student Code. <strong>By default, every member of the homework group will be given the same penalty.</strong> (Again, this is the same standard that is applied to co-authors of research papers.) If you cheat, you are not only endangering your grade, and possibly your academic career, but your colleagues as well.</p>
